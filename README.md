# Basic Onshape CAD
## Caster Base
### I think this is a pretty cool website. I head a couple hurdles to get over like figuring out how to rotate my perspective using right click. But other than that I didn't have any issues what so ever. I really like that I can just type in a dimension and I don't have to manually enter it. Over the next few weeks I think I can pretty easily get to the same skill and mastery level I am with Solidworks.

## Caster Mount
### My favorite part about this is the whole use function. It's really neat how it saves you a lot of time/energy. I'm not sure if Solidworks has this, but this is definitely a pro for Onshape. I also thought that it's pretty cool that Onshape also has the variable option. I messed up when I was creating the last line because I dimensioned it from the wrong side, but other than that this was a smooth ride.

## Caster Fork
### This was super easy and simple. Almost everything translates directly from Solidworks to Onshape. 10/10 transition.

## Caster Tire
### This really cemented my tranistion from Solidworks to Onshape, honestly I think this was easier in Onshape than Solidworks. Everything was super simple and made sense, I really understood what I was doing compared to Solidworks. I also learned how to change the color and I'm pretty sure it was a lot simpler than in Solidworks because I really only had to click like twice.

## Caster Wheel
### This part was pretty cool. I remember when I first made this for Engineering 1 I had some troubles with the sketch and getting everything right. I also had some problems this time, but that was on me. I forgot one key dimension when I was watching the video the first time but I realized it a couple minutes later. I like that we don't have to make everything close geometry, same thing with the face wide fillets. Even though that is a feature in Solidworks, it's cool that it's also on Onshape. 

## Caster Axle, Collar, and Bearings
### Each on of these was super simple and quick which I enjoyed. For the axle and collar I think it's really cool that we can select which parts are affected by the extrusion. We also used some interesting technique to avoid using dimensions to constrain something. I can defenitely see that being useful for bigger and more complicated projects. When we added the bearing to the wheel, I enjoyed the simplicity of using the "Use" tool when sketching and extruding off of a previous sketch. 

## Caster Sub-Assembly
### This was the first time I've ever used Onshapes mates. Personally, I'm not a fan. It's difficult to know what you want to select. I assume that I will get better with this over time, but it felt very different.

## Caster Assembly
### At the begining I was having a tough time with mates, but it's slowly growing on me. I kept messing up the mates for the set screws, I was getting a lot of errors/issues but I finally figured it out. Adding bolts and nuts seems much easier than in Solidworks. 

## Dorothy's Dowel Pins
### This was actually a lot of fun, I think I learned a lot doing this by my self rather than relying on a video. I messed up some of my relations in the begining when I was making the panels of wood for the frame, but I managed to fix it in a couple minutes. After that it was just smooth sailing!
