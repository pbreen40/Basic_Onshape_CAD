# Basic_Onshape_CAD

Caster Base:
    I think this is a pretty cool website. I head a couple hurdles to get over like figuring out how to rotate my perspective using right click. But other than that I didn't have     any issues what so ever. I really like that I can just type in a dimension and I don't have to manually enter it. Over the next few weeks I think I can pretty easily get to       the same skill and mastery level I am with SolidWorks.
